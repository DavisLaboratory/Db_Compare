# Db_Compare

*NOTE: only works on Mac or Linux OS*

`Db_Compare` does [@HannahHuckstep, give a one sentence explanation of what this repo does ðŸ˜Š]
 
## Requirements

The following `conda` command will create an environment called `DbCompareConda` with all dependencies installed

```
conda create --name DbCompareConda \
  --channel conda-forge \
  --channel bioconda \
  python=3 \
  pandas \
  requests \
  urllib3 \
  r=3.6 \
  r-upsetr \
  r-sna \
  r-plotrix \
  r-ggplot2 \
  bioconductor-clusterprofiler \
  bioconductor-org.hs.eg.db \
  pandoc \
  openjdk=8
```

## Usage

To run `Db_Compare` follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo (as below) or create a new directory and place the provided scripts, files and folders inside.

```
git clone https://github.com/HannahHuckstep/Db_Compare.git
```

2. [OPTIONAL] download the most current version of databases into `Db_Compare/`. By default `Db_Compare` 
will use the database file in `refDatabaseFiles.zip` and `sigDatabaseFiles.zip`. 
See the bullet points further down the page for names and locations of databases.

3. Then run the bash script after navigating to the `Db_Compare/` directory. 

```{bash}
conda activate DbCompareConda
cd Db_Compare/
bash dbCompareScript.bash

# Enter directory name
> <dirName> [@HannahHuckstep, this needs to be documented better ðŸ˜Š]
```


4. Once the analysis has completed open `dbCompareNotebook.html` to view the resulting plots.
The consistency analysis results can be found in each's database directory (For Reactome, PhosphoSitePlus, HPRD, and qPhos)
